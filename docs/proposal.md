# Final project proposal
This file is the template for your final project proposal. Please update this file with your proposal details (delete these first two sentences, please :slightly_smiling_face:)

## Hardware/software proposal 1 - Water quality sensor

Describe one of the hardware and software proposals. The hardware and software must work together. Include a brief description of the hardware/software interface (e.g., what sort of registers will you create/use, etc.)

## Hardware/software proposal 2 - Buzzer 
The buzzer will respond to the water quality level and output sound when triggered. Possibly looking at a warning and a danger output based on water quality. The hardware would be writing vhdl to output the necessary signals for this device to work.

## Extra credit
Define any extra credit proposals here.

## Division of labor
Briefly describe who will be working on what. For extra credit tasks and any software above the driver level, it is okay for both group members to work on a single piece, so long as the division of labor and responsibilities are clear.
