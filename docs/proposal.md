# Final project proposal

## Hardware
For the hardware of this project, it will be split up as follows:

1. will produce the hardware to connect the water TDS sensore to the fpga through the ADC. He will also use a LED bar to show voltage level.

2. Will produce the hardware of a circuit that will be two LEDs and a buzzer.

## Software
For the Software of this project, it will be split up as follows:

1. The buzzer will respond to the water quality level and output sound when triggered. Possibly looking at a warning and a danger output based on water quality. The hardware would be writing vhdl to output the necessary signals for this device to work.

2. The digital ouput from the ADC will be fed into from the ARM chip to the FPGA chip that will then output in the LED bar the level of voltage generated from the water TDS sensor.
