## System Overview

This project aims to create an enviornmental monitoring system, where water quality is monitored and the system alerts through both visual and auditory means if the quality drops below a set amount. The auditory alerts are implemented through a buzzer, that makes an awful sounds when triggered. The visual alerts are implemented through an led bar. These alerts are triggered by reading a water content sensor.

## Buzzer

The buzzer was implemented in VHDL by creating a square wave of variable period. This had a fixed 50% duty cycle, to more closely resemble a sine wave. This was further altered from the led control system by having the period value expanded to handle the higher frequencies required for auditory systems. This component was then connected to the avalon memory mapping interface and exported to the system level through a device tree and driver file. Further implementation of this component in software was not achieved during the project timeframe.

## Water Sensor
The water sensor was designd with the adc in mind. Use the already developed adc device tree, the ARM chip would read in the values of the digital number that the adc would calclulate from the analog signal from the sensor there would be a LED display setup on the LED bar on the de10nano. From what the usual value system of the tds number the led bar would light up after the number read surpassed 500 which shows us that there are a unsafe amount of contaminants in the water.

## Conclusion

Personally, We found this project fun. Seeing custom drivers and device implementation of something we made was actually super cool (by our standards ðŸ¤“). This project was close to completion with the final integration and bug checking not completed within the timeframe. This could have been improved time wise with more fluid git handling, but this would have required a significant amount of additional communication which would have added its own time cost. Regarding improving the course, one thing that was not mentioned prior that would be really cool is a lecture on low level device handling for other operating systems or architectures. If you wanted to work on a system that was built on windows or mac how would that be approached? Devices such as the LeCroy oscilloscopes etc.
